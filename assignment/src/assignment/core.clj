;; RUN CODE:
;; Alt+Enter
;; SEE FULL RESULT:
;; Ctrl+K
;; ESCAPE - To clear debug stuff
;; Ctrl+Alt+Enter will evaluate the current enclosing form up to the cursor.
;; To see the result at each step in the thread
;; You can also Ctrl+Alt+Enter after each form
;; Shift+Alt+Enter will evaluate all code from
;; the start of the current top level form, up until
;; the cursor, with all open brackets closed.

;; Evauluate Current Form: ctrl+enter
;; Evaluate Current Top Level Form (defun), alt+enter.
